\section*{Introduction}
This document outlines my journey to rice my Manjaro Linux installation using Niri as my base.
I want it to be short, but very explainatory, or at lest give the tools to search if something does not go as intended.
I'll try to do as many tables or bullet points to make everyting clear.
You will see a tendency to stable versions of things, that's beceuse I am still studing computer science in Barcelona's University
and I don't want to get too many problems while working, that also explains.

With this two things in mind, the decision of choosing Manjaro is clear: \\
 -An easy way to get Niri working. \\
 -More Stable than Arch. \\
\\
I don't want to get super nerdy with this Project, I just want a place to copy my config if needed

\section{Initial Configuration}

\subsection*{Why Niri}
Because I like tiling window managers, but i often feel like all windows are to small to make it usable.
Niri presents itself as a solution to this issue.
